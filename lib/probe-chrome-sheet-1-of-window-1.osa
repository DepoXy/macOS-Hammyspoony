# ISOFF/2024-07-28: It's probably quicker to invoke AppleScript inline.
# - E.g., call hs.osascript.applescript with string,
#   vs. calling hs.osascript.applescriptFromFile with path
#   to this file.
# - Though I didn't check sources. Who knows, maybe Hammerspoon writes
#   string to a file and runs that through AppleScript (tho doubtful).
